Parrot Wi-Fi Problem:
The wireless network is connected but not able to use the internet.
It initially connected and worked fine but at random intervals, it just stopped, worked, and so on.

A couple of searches on the internet showed that it could be the problem with the network drivers and all, well I figured it had connected before so that 
for me ruled the network drives issue out. Found the same issues as mine in the subreddits but it seemed to have not been answered.

So decided I would mess around and try breaking some stuff possibly.

1. Checked the resolv.conf file, it had a local IP in there, nothing else.
2. I had seen that this file needed to contain some nameservers like 8.8.8.8,1.1.1.1 and so on. Put them in.
    $sudo pluma /etc/resolv.conf 
    # Generated by NetworkManager
    nameserver 8.8.8.8

3. Try restarting the network manager. No change.
4. Wen to Control Center as I had also seen it talked about a lot, then -> Network Proxy.
5. Here I set the proxy to Direct Internet Access.
 then lastly restart my network with two commands:

 i. sudo systemctl restart networking.service
ii. sudo systemctl restart network-online.target

Boom! It worked!!
